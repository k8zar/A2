				<figcaption>
				To address my first overall analysis question, here I have plotted median population, distinguished by type of housing, across Boston neighborhoods. The median population values are taken from census year 2020, as the data in this dataset is only from that year, despite its claims to represent years 2004 - 2024. Colors indicate different housing types. Total population per neighborhood is indicated by cumulative bar height. Immediately from this chart, we pick out there are a huge number of college students, living all over the city.
