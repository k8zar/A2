			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Where is the housing in Boston?</li>
					My motivation for this question was both from my own experience looking for apartments, and from trying to understand the dataset we have to work with for this assignment. As a renter who has looked for places to live on more than one occasion in the city, I am curious to know where the majority of housing resides. As a data analyst in this class, I am curious to get a better sense of where housing is, to be able to correlate geo-spatially with other data with the goal of understanding where demand is to live, where people can live (because of existing housing), and what in different areas might be driving those factors.

				<li>Are neighborhoods racially diverse, or segregated by race?</li>
					I am originally from Chicago, one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States even to this day. I was curious to know if Boston is similar to Chicago or New York in this way. From the readings associated with this dataset, it is also clear that POC disproportionally experience housing insecurity in the form of evictions. I'm curious to know if that is localized to certain neighborhoods or not.

				<li>Are neighborhoods segregated by age? </li>
					I think of Boston as student heavy city, but with universities in many locations. I'm curious if that leads to student population being localized to certain neighborhoods or not.

				<li>Are neighborhoods predominantly composed of corporate or owner-occupied housing?</li>
					This question is espcially inspired by the questions about neighborhood segregation by race or age. I wonder if the type of ownership can be correlated with race or age, and if that tells a story about the quality of housing by neighborhood. The quality component is likely not something I can comment on using the data in this dataset, but with an eye towards the final project I am curious to start to map out trends in housing age, quality, and affordability by neighborhood, which I am curious to see if ownership status correlates with at all.

				<img src="images/Fig1.png" alt="Bar chart of median population in different housing types, by Boston neighborhood" />
				<figcaption>
				To address my first overall analysis question, here I have plotted median population, distinguished by type of housing, across Boston neighborhoods. The median population values are taken from census year 2020, as the data in this dataset is only from that year, despite its claims to represent years 2004 - 2024. Colors indicate different housing types. Total population per neighborhood is indicated by cumulative bar height. Immediately from this chart, we pick out there are a huge number of college students, living all over the city.

				<figcaption>
				To address my second overall analysis question, I plotted median population, distinguished by race, across Boston neighborhoods. The median values are taken from census year 2020. Colors are used to indicate race. To prevent double counting, only individual races are included. The U.S. census allows for participants to check all boxes that apply, for which categories exist for those who select two or more boxes (Citation at https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html"). This data is also included in data for a single race. The option for race "other" is also included. Bar height indicates total population in a neighborhood. We see from this plot that Boston is predominantly white, with Dorchester being especially diverse relative to other neighborhoods. Interestingly, neighborhoods with especially high student populations from Figure 1 do not seem more racially diverse, which surprised me. I expected the student body recruited to colleges in this area to be especially diverse, and for college neighborhoods to reflect that, however we see here that is perhaps only true for the neighborhood Roxbury.

				<figcaption>
				Having a sense of the demographic breakdown by neighborhood, my next question was how much total available housing each neighborhood had. I plotted the median total housing units by neighborhood as reported by the 2020 census. Dot height indicates the number of housing units. Colors are used for further visual aid to distinguish neighborhoods. The y-axis is log-scaled to help distinguish small differences between points. We see that Dorchester, our most diverse neighborhood, has the largest amount of available housing. Roxbury and Brighton are next highest, both of which had higher student populations in Figure 1, compared to Dorchester. Roxbury had a smaller white population compared to other neighborhoods, with Brighton having a larger white population. Longwood, almost an enitrely student based area, clearly has the least amount of total housing. Though it is interesting that Dorchester, the most racially diverse neighborhood also has the largest number of total housing units, it is difficult to draw trends across demographic lines multiple neighborhoods follow, at least from these three visualizations.

				Since I was having trouble seeing any correlations, from the first pass overview plots I had made (Figs1-3), my next thought was to examine my exclusion of the ambiguous race categories. Returning to a bar chart to mirror Figure 2, I next plotted the race category "two or more races" to see if the distribution of folks who identified with these categories would be any significantly different from what was seen in Figure 2. It seems as though this was not insightful, this bar chart mirrors Figure 2.

				<img src="images/Fig5.png" alt="Satellite map with circle mark overlay. Circles represent population age 17 and under" />
				<figcaption>
				I decided to expand my analysis next since previous plots had been helpful for visualizing the data, but difficult to draw trends or interpretation from. To begin to probe my third question, I plotted the population below age 17, with population amount encoded on the mark size, by neighborhood on a map. Here, we see that minors mostly live in Dorchester. Upon further inspection, the four zip codes associated with Dorchester each have the same population number associated with them. It is possible that each has the same number of people below age 17 living in that area, but it seems unlikely. Either way, it is clear that Dorchester, an area with the most available housing and least number of students has the highest population of people at or under the age of 17.

				<img src="images/Fig6.png" alt="Bubble plot of population ages 18 plus by Boston neighborhood" />
				<figcaption>
				I next wanted to see if there were trends in the data for the remainder of ages, 18 plus. I made a bubble chart encoding the population age 18+ by neighborhood, from the 2020 census data. Larger population count corresponds to larger bubble size. Color is used to visually distinguish neighborhoods. Dorchester data is confined to one of the four zip codes, for which all four reported the same population value again, indicating to me that this was indeed getting counted more than once. I removed the map background here, I found it distracting in Figure 5. Again, Dorchester has the greatest population, which to me emphasizes that there is a lot of available housing in that neighborhood, so there is also a large population living there.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Fig7.png" alt="Map of corporate ownership rate by neighborhood" />
				<figcaption>
				From the figures I have generated thus far, I now know that Dorchester is the most racially diverse, highly populated across all ages, and has few students. My next question was whether the housing in this area was mostly corporately owned, or owner-occupied units. Here, I plot the corportate ownership rate by neighborhood on a map. We see that Dorchester has low corporate ownership rate, but not the lowest like neighborhoods West Roxbury or Back Bay. Interestingly, waterfront downtown areas seem to have especially high corporate ownership rates, with those rates decreasing moving away from the city center and inland.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Fig8.png" alt="Satellite map of owner-occupied rate by neighborhood" />
				<figcaption>
				To corroberate the map in Figure 7, I next plotted the owner-occupied rate by neighborhood. I both wanted to make sure the dataset made sense (where there was low corporate ownership there was high owners-occupancy and vice versa). This sanity check was a success, the rates do seem to follow this basic intuition. This prompted a new question, which was how these rates correlated with housing type, specifically vacancies, which my previously plots had not investigated and which I explore in Figures 9 and 10.
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Fig9.png" alt="Stacked area plot of total housing units and vacancies over corporate ownership rate">
				<figcaption>
				Builing off of the questions generated by Figure 8, here I investigate the total housing available against the vacancies in each neighborhood, stacked against the corporate ownership rate. Interestingly, the total housing and vacancies seem to follow the same trend. The corporate ownership rate here looks relatively flat across the neighborhoods, with the exception of Longwood, where both the total housing and vacancies decrease and corporate ownership is at a maximum. We also see a maximum in corporate ownership rate downtown, which we had previously confirmed by our map of the corporate owernship rate.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Fig10.png" alt="Stacked area plot of total housing units and vacancies over owner-occupancy rate">
				<figcaption>
				In conjunction with Figure 9, we plot the same total housing units and vacancy units, but now with the owner-occupancy rate. Here, we see the most correlation yet: a strong minimum in owner-occupancy rate in Longwood, where corporate ownership is high, and total housing is low. Also interestingly, owner-occupancy is high in West Roxbury, where total housing is high and vacancy is low. This leads me to ask if, like the readings for this dataset suggest, we have trends in both total housing available as well as lack of vacancies correlating with owner occupancy of property, which I would be intersted to explore further with an expanded dataset, particularly over time.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Here, we investigated U.S. Census data from 2020 on housing demographics from Boston-area zip codes. We were able to correlate corporate-ownership rate and location, finding that there was a higher rate of corporate ownership downtown and in waterfront neighborhoods relative to inland neighborhoods further from the downtown. We were also able to see decreased vacancies with higher owner-occupancy rates, though the correlation we observe is certainly not causation. From analysis of racial demographics by neighborhood, we find Boston to be predominantly white. Neighborhoods away from the downtown and college campus areas tend to be more diverse, with Dorchester being the most diverse. We postulate this could be because of the low corporate ownership rate and high housing units in the neighborhood, but without additional data it is difficult to make strong claims as to why this may be. </p>
			<p>In this analysis, little was done to transform the data as provided from the csv file itself. In the case of the map data, some zip codes were excluded on account of their being so spatially localized. In other plots, we chose to use data from a single Dorchester zip code as we suspected the data was replicated across all four zip codes, as opposed to being specific to each area. I did not perform additional calculations on the dataset in the plots I made, mostly because the dataset was limited, which made it very diffcult to ask specific questions. Many of the visualizations I chose to include for this assignment are mean to look for trends, rather than highlight known existing truths. The dataset promised a time axis, however I discovered quickly that the data from 2020 was replicated to give the appearance of a time axis, but was in actuality all from a single year. Had this axis existed, faceting the data and performing more calculations on the existing categories could have been more relevant than I found it to be with this dataset alone.</p>
			<p>I also note that many of the plots were in similar forms (bar chart, map, or bubble chart). The continuity of chart across multiple analysis questions was mostly done to be able to more faithfully compare trends across very different facets of the dataset. Looking at demographics by neighborhood is already restrictive of an aspect of the data, and being able to compare lengths or sizes by neighborhood category across different lenses offered by this dataset I found helpful, which is why I chose these visualizations. I recognize that the many colors used to further visually encode the data within the visualizations is overall more distracting than demonstrative of trends, however I found it incredibly useful for understanding the data by neighborhood. If the bar charts had yielded clearer trends, it could have made sense to further facet and downselect the data to investigate, however with this particular dataset my bar charts prompted me to do the opposite, due to a lack of apparent trend. Instead I found mapping the data geo-spatially and looking at housing type by neighborhood the most insightful. </p>
